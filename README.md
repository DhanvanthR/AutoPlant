# AutoPlant
Code for an Automatic Plant Watering System, designed using an Arduino MKR Wifi 1010. Harnesses the power of IoT and the Cloud to perform its task anywhere, anytime.

Implemented with a waterproof pump, soil sensor, LDR (light capacitor), and Arduino Cloud. Checks to see if the soil is saturated enough for the plant (aka is it watered?); if so, keep reading until the plant needs it, else water the plant for a set time until the soil is back to its normal saturation level. Also waters based on the time of day (enter: the LDR sensor). Operates anywhere thanks to the power of the Arduino IoT Cloud.
