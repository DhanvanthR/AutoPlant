# AutoPlant
Code for an Automatic Plant Watering Robot, designed using an Arduino MKR Wifi 1010. Harnesses the power of IoT and the Cloud to perform its task anywhere, anytime.

Implemented with a waterproof pump, soil sensor, and Arduino Cloud. Checks to see if the soil is saturated enough for the plant (aka is it watered?); if so, keep reading until the plant needs it, else water the plant for a set time until the soil is back to its normal saturation level. Operates anywhere thanks to the power of the Arduino IoT Cloud.
